# IBMDataScienceCapstone
This repository contains the capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

The project analyzes SpaceX mission data, collected through the SpaceX API and web scraping, to identify trends and key factors influencing mission success. The ultimate goal is to enable a competitor to estimate the cost of a launch—particularly in light of SpaceX’s competitive edge: reusable first-stage rockets.

Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Folium, and Dash, the project includes exploratory data analysis covering launch outcomes, site locations, orbital trajectories, and payload sizes.

In the final phase, machine learning models are developed and evaluated to assess whether mission success can be predicted based on these features.
